Middleware:

1. Authentication Middleware:
Purpose: Ensures that the user is authenticated before allowing access to certain routes.
Process:
Extract the token from the Authorization header.
Validate the token.
If valid, extract user information and attach it to the request context.
If invalid, return an unauthorized response.
Endpoints Covered: Typically covers all endpoints except public ones like user registration and login.
2. Authorization Middleware:
Purpose: Ensures the user has the right permissions to perform certain actions.
Process:
Define roles and permissions in your system (e.g., admin, regular user).
Check the user's role or permissions attached to the request context.
Verify if the user is permitted to perform the requested action.
If not permitted, return a forbidden response.
Endpoints Covered: Any sensitive endpoint that requires specific user roles or permissions.
3. Logging Middleware:
Purpose: Logs incoming requests and outgoing responses for monitoring and debugging.
Process:
Log the incoming request path, method, and possibly body.
Log the outgoing response status and possibly a summary of the content.
Optionally include additional information like request duration, user ID, etc.
Endpoints Covered: Typically covers all endpoints to provide a comprehensive log.
4. Error Handling Middleware:
Purpose: Catches and formats error responses uniformly.
Process:
Catch exceptions thrown from downstream middleware or handlers.
Log the error details for internal use.
Format a user-friendly error message and response, including status code.
Ensure no sensitive error details are exposed to the client.
Endpoints Covered: Typically covers all endpoints to ensure all errors are handled consistently.
5. Rate Limiting Middleware:
Purpose: Prevents abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a certain period.
Process:
Keep track of the number of requests from a user or IP address over a sliding window of time.
If the request count exceeds the limit, return a rate limit exceeded response.
Otherwise, allow the request to proceed.
Endpoints Covered: Can cover all endpoints or just those that are particularly expensive or vulnerable to abuse.
6. CORS Middleware:
Purpose: Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings to specify who can access the API.
Process:
Define allowed origins, headers, methods, and credentials.
Check incoming requests against these settings.
Include the appropriate CORS headers in the response.
Endpoints Covered: Typically covers all endpoints to ensure CORS policy is enforced.
